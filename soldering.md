# Soldering

Often you will need to do some soldering so it is a convenient (and fun) skill to
have.

## Technique

I won't give details about the technique, there are already outstanding
tutorials on Youtube. Also you might be interested to watch a video like
[10 STUPID ERRORS To AVOID in Soldering and TIPS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fp37DPZVdRI)
before you solder for the first time (the format of the video is maybe
a bit questionable but the technique is impeccable).

If soldering does not work it always boils down to one of:

  - **Temperature**. The component or the board is not hot enough, the solder
  melts but does not stick. Watch out for the contact point of the soldering
  iron, it must heat both the component and the board. The soldering tip must
  always be tinned to increase the surface of contact and improve heat
  conductivity. Still, sometimes it's not possible to heat the board properly
  (e.g. because there is a large copper plane acting as a heatsink that dissipates
  the heat), in this case try to preheat the board from below or with a hot air
  gun, but do *not* try to increase the working temperature.
  - **Not enough flux**. Always use flux, it doesn't harm.
  See [When to use Flux ?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfIwHuGzUEk).
  - **Oxides**. Try to freshen up the contact by removing the oxide layer with
  steel wool. Flux can also help.
  

## Tools

Here is an idea of the tools that are needed for soldering:

  - **Soldering iron**. Preferably one with adjustable temperature. Working
  temperature is 300 - 350 degrees Celsius. Do not use higher temperature, this is
  most likely a mistake. Sustained high temperatures is useless and can
  irreversibly damage the soldering tip.
  - **Iron holder**. To safely hold the soldering iron when
  you are not using it.
  - **Damp sponge**. To clean the old solder off your soldering tip every time
  after soldering.
  - **Iron brass cleaner**. To scrape off oxides and combustion residues from your
  soldering iron that cannot be cleaned with the sponge. It is made out of
  brass, which is weaker than iron so that it does not damage the soldering tip.
  You will need to use the brass cleaner almost every time after the sponge.
  - **Set of soldering tips**. Most of the time you will use a medium chisel tip,
  but every so often you will need finer or more specialized tips to solder onto
  SMD components, so it's good to have a set available.
  - **Solder wire**. Use lead-free (RoHS) solder wire with a flux core (which are
  the most common ones anyway). You want a diameter smaller than 1 mm. I currently
  use 0.8 mm.
  - **Soldering flux**. Flux is an additive that enhances the behavior of solder.
  For most ad-hoc soldering jobs you will want to have flux at reach, otherwise it
  might be extremely difficult or impossible to solder. Flux comes in a variety of
  packages, I currently use a syringe.
  - **Isopropyl alcohol**. This is to clean residual flux when you're done with
  your soldering job. I specifically recommend *pure* isopropyl alcohol because:
  (1) it is a good organic solvant, (2) it is volatile so it dries quickly,
  (3) it is a good electric insulator, (4) it's cheap.
  - **Cloth**. To clean off flux residue dissolved in isopropyl alcohol (I
  recycle worn out cotton clothes).
  - **Brush**. I have a dedicated 13 mm rectangular brush to finish cleaning jobs.
